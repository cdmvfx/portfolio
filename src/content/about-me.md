## Hello! My name is Carlos Daniel Montero.

I am a full stack web developer looking to improve my skillset in all areas of the development spectrum: everything from infrastructure to user experience.

My journey to developer began very differently than most. For years at the beginning of my career, I was heavily involved in the videography field. I have a deep passion for creativity, and as a result I found I was best able to express myself via the medium I enjoyed the most: video.

What began as a hobby in high school turned into a major achievement when I reached 80,000+ subscribers on YouTube. My content revolved around video games, specifically editing clips together synced to music with effects.

While I was studying Media Production at the University of Central Florida, I learned about the ins-and-outs of the radio/television industry. I also got the amazing opportunity to intern at Adrenaline Films, the premier production house in Orlando that produces content in collaboration with Universal Studios Orlando.

I was able to learn more about the web development field after starting my next position as a Video Editor and Web Developer. Initially starting with small widgets to embed on the company Wordpress website, which then evolved into developing a full-scale administrative dashboard in React that integrates with multiple APIs.

Over the course of the past 3 years, I discovered a passion for the intersection of creativity and logic. I found that development is incredibly fulfilling in that way! I love challenges and working to solve problems, while also being creative with an eye for details. I'm always looking to learn, improve, and overcome any obstacle that comes my way.

For that reason, I'm seeking a position to further my abilities as a software developer alongside a team of like-minded people.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
