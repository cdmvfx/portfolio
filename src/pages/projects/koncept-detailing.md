## Overview
Kevin Martinez is a 8-year retired veteran from the United States Marine Corps. Having a passion for cars, he began a detailing business soon after leaving the military. Over time he was able to make detailing his full-time job, working completely from word-of-mouth.

I worked with him to develop a unique website to serve as an all-in-one hub for him to show off his client work, services he offers, testimonials, and to be able for clients to schedule with him instantly right on the website.

## Development & Design
Being a veteran, I believed it would be best for the Koncept Detailing website to simulate a mil-tech aesthetic together with a modern and sleek appearance reflecting the premium quality of his car details.

I designed the website as a single page NextJS application using Tailwind, Framer Motion, and other utility libraries. Scheduling is made possible via the Calendly API to handle bookings and payments. The contact form is integrated with the Vonage API to notify him directly via text message.

## Impact
By running Facebook and Instagram ads for his website, Kevin has seen a 3X boost in detailing appointments. As a result he is now able to charge a premium rate in the Tampa area compared to other local competitors.

In addition, the integration with the Calendly API has made managing his appointments a breeze, giving him more time to do the things he loves versus dealing with the business side.
