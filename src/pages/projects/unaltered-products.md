## Overview
At UNALTERED Athletics, I oversaw the design of all creative elements for the products. This included everything ranging from website design, to the product labels and packaging, to product images and videos that would be presented on the marketplaces.

## Design Process
My method to designing each product varied depending on what the product was aiming to do. Because our primary sales channel was Amazon, the focus was first and foremost uniqueness. In a sea of competitors, customers have an increasing number of options between products for almost every search phrase.

As such, our products had to stand out. They had to be bold, relevant, and aesthetically designed to perfectly match what the customer was searching for. We conducted surveys throughout each of the products' design process, experimenting with elements such as font size, vector graphics, colors, and layout. This gave us a better picture of what designs work and will convert to sales.

## Impact
A work of the team as a whole, the UNALTERED supplement line is dominant in the ranking for various high-volume high-competitor search phrases on Amazon, such as *"belly fat burner"* and *"testosterone booster"*.

Our surveys have shown our product designs are respondents #1 choice compared to our competitors when asked which product they would purchase.
