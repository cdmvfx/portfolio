## Overview
UNALTERED Admin is a multi-dashboard custom built for the UNALTERED staff to view sales channel analytics, log key product events, perform product research, and manage the [UNALTERED Services](/projects/unaltered-services).

Developed as a private Shopify application, the project makes use of Shopify's API for authentication and authorization. This allows for gated permissions for the staff members that use the application.

## Features

### Product Manager
The Product Manager is the all-in-one tool for managing product listing and sales analytics across all marketplaces, as well as tracking important events and information regarding inventory.

It is integrated with the Amazon, Ebay, Walmart, and Shopify APIs to retrieve and consolidate sales and listing data into one place.

Notable tools in the product manager include daily sales analytics, product listing manager, profit calculator, purchase order log, inventory shipments log, marketplace experiment analyzer, and review program manager.

### Product Research
The Product Research dashboard is the primary way the UNALTERED product development team is able to conduct research regarding potential new products.

This dashboard allows the staff to retrieve up-to-date information from the Amazon Selling Partner API to determine revenue estimations, competitor weaknesses, and market interest. This extensive amount of research is performed before a product is developed and launch to market, in order to increase the likelihood of success.

### Services Managers
Some of the [UNALTERED Services](/projects/unaltered-services) have data that is able to be managed via the Admin dashboard. For example, all submissions to the Review Collection Form, Review Program, and Surveys can be seen and filtered in a single table. Products and surveys can be added, removed, and deleted from the respective dashboards.

## Impact
Having multiple products split amongst multiple sales channels, it was difficult for the sales team at UNALTERED to consistently keep track of sales data and product history. Since my development of the UNALTERED Admin application, productivity has boomed as there is now a user-friendly way to automatically grab data for any of the products for any given date range across all marketplaces.

In addition, the product development team has seen huge improvements in productivity from the usage of the Product Research dashboard. Previously, performing competitor analysis and calculating product success was difficult to keep track of. Now, the team has a streamlined methodology all the way from conceptualizing a product, to the planning of the product listing.

Overall, the dashboard has made it easier for team members to collaborate and bring further success to the company.
