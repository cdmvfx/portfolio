## Overview
The UNALTERED Hormone Balance is a nutritional supplement created for women to remedy symptoms of hormonal imbalances. I designed all of the product's creative elements: label design, box design, renders, product video, ads, product page images, and product page design.

## Design Process
The product targets women of all ages who suffer from various issues: bloating, fatigue, stress, and more. Therefore, the theme when creating the product branding was to demonstrate a positive, healthy, and relaxed lifestyle.

In a survey conducted with a focus group, the majority of respondents felt that the imagery of nature, soft shapes, and light colors were more effective in eliciting relief when compared to the product competitors.

By the final revision, our research showed that the product was respondents #1 choice when asked the question "If you were looking for a nutritional supplement that would help you feel better, which would you choose?"

## Impact
The UNALTERED Hormone Balance had the most successful product launch out of any UNALTERED product in company history. Just two months after release, the product stands at over 300+ ratings with 4.3 stars on Amazon.
