## Overview
*"UNALTERED Fitness Minute"* is a regular series which I scripted and produced for UNALTERED Athletics. They range between 3-5 minutes and explain different concepts within fitness and health.

## Production Process
The series was created to be published primarily on LinkedIn, but also Tiktok, YouTube, and Instagram. Because the primary audience was business professionals and entrepreneurs, each video had to be concise and straight to the point. We positioned ourselves as the quick, weekly digest for health and fitness content.

I wrote the scripts by gathering information from many trusted sources, including only the most relevant and actionable tips for our audience. I experimented with various introductions, graphics, animations, and editing styles to discover which format would keep viewers' watch time and engagement.

## Impact
Across all social media, the UNALTERED Fitness Minutes have accumulated over 50,000+ followers. They have amounted over 1 million cumulative views, and continue being the driving force behind social media growth.
